# ToDoList
This app allows the user to create a To-Do list and check off and remove tasks.

## About The Project
This app uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript in React to create an interactive to-do list. This is an exercise for MIT x Pro's Professional Certificate in Coding: Web Development, and is meant to build familiarity with React applications. 

## How to Run
In order to run this application, the user will have to download the files, and run it on a local server. 

## Future Improvements
I aim to fix the issue that exists currently where when a user removes a checked tag from the top of the list, it checks off the tag under it. I would also like to add a strikethrough when tasks are checked off, and refine the styles some more. 

## License
This program was made with files from MIT x Pro's course. More information can be found in the LICENSE file.
